# WaveFitness
This is the Official Repo for Wave Fitness, an app dedicated to helping music lovers enjoy their exercise more.

# Important:
When comitting, *please* comment your changes in a professional manner, somewhat how I have already. Not only does it mean we have no issues when it comes to doccumenting changes, but it also keeps the Git looking clean, tidy and professionally.

# If unsure on commits
If you're unsure on your commits, commit to a new branch and *don't* pull to master until you've check 100% with others that the code is fine to override - no more repo moves!

# Important changes to be made:
- Split the methods into new classes, for example, authentication, so that we can pull the app into sections to be nicely slotted into the running experience. 
- Allow a user to search or choose a genre, and then have the app search the spotify library, and plug in a song/album/artist/playlist ID into the "private static final String TEST_SONG_URI = "id";" field.
- Updated the UI to better represent the mockups created.
- Impliment the code with had in previous repo's, such as the running/map functionality.
